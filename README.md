Abel Rodriguez, Andres Montemayor, Jordan Gutierrez

this app will be focused on helping the users find lost items on different parts of campus. 
lets different parts of the lost and found building departments to report items that where lost which lets users find items quickly

we are going to using python to create this software we are also going to implementing different add on to help us create this software so it wont be completely phython

based on the users feedback during out testing phase we will fix and develop the app so that the user has a better time at moving around the app

we will make this app unique by having official building offices be able to post and be verified and then lets students have automatics account to reply or ask questions relating to items that where lost and found
maybe have a system also where if you help a student out you get points which in turn will let you get small items for your acts of service
